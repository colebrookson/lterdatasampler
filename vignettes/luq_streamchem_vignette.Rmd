### Dataset sample used

- `luq_streamchem`



# Introduction

This vignette highlights:

- How to explore change points in time-series
- How to use long format to create facet plots


The `luq_streamchem` data sample contains a subset of stream flow chemistry data for the Quebrada Sonadora (QS) site within the Espiritu Santo drainage basin and the El Verde Research area of the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF). The Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF) has been a center of tropical forestry research for nearly a century. In addition, the LEF is a recreation site for over a half a million people per year, a water supply for approximately 20% of Puerto Ricoâ€™s population, a regional center for electronic communication, and a refuge of Caribbean biodiversity. QS is the high elevation site.

# Exploring the time-series

```{r setup}
library(lterdatasampler)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Ice Cover Duration Data


```{r glimpse}
glimpse(luq_streamchem)
```


## Plotting one chemical

Let's start with looking at the time-series of potassium

```{r, fig.height=5.5, fig.width=6.5}
ggplot(data=luq_streamchem, aes(x=sample_date, y=k)) +
  geom_line(color="#69b3a2") + 
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Potassium [mg/L]") 
```

Wow there is definitely something going on at the end of 1989!

## Plotting all water quality indicators

We are not sure if all the chemicals and water quality indicators have been monitored over the same time period, or if their value will also show strong variations at the end of 1989. To explore this we will transform our data frame into long format so we can use `ggplot2::facet_wrap()` to quickly plot all observed stream chemistry variables at once. Note we are using the `scales = free` option since the concentrations (and units) vary greatly among the different variables.

```{r}
# Switching to long format
luq_streamchem_long <- luq_streamchem %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(sample_id, sample_date), names_to = "chem_param") 

ggplot(luq_streamchem_long, aes(sample_date, value)) + 
  geom_line(color="#69b3a2") + 
  facet_wrap(vars(chem_param), scales = "free")

```

It seems that other chemicals are also showing a jump around the end of 1989. Actually those jumps are due to Hurricane Hugo which made landfall in Puerto Rico at the beginning of September 1989. In its aftermath, average stream water exports of potassium, nitrate and ammonium increased in the year after the landfall by 119, 182 and 102% respectively compared to the other years of record.

# Detecting change points in a time-series

Let's first confirm that the timing of the jump in the time-series corresponds to Hurricane Hugo by adding a vertical line at the date of hurricane landfall.

```{r}
ggplot(luq_streamchem, aes(x=sample_date, y=k)) +
  geom_line(color="#69b3a2") + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("1989-09-18"), 
             linetype = "dashed") +
  xlab("") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1)) +
  labs(title = "Potassium [mg/L]") 

```

Now we can use `changepoint` to try to automatically detect the change points in the time series.

## Changes in mean potassium concentration

Let's try to detect change in mean using the `PELT` algorithm:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(changepoint)

k_ts <- luq_streamchem %>% 
  select(k) %>% 
  drop_na() # Drop rows with missing values

ansmean <- cpt.mean(k_ts$k)
plot(ansmean,cpt.col='red')

```

I does not seem that the algorithm can detect well the change in potassium mean.

## Changes in variance of potassium concentration

```{r}
ansvar <- cpt.var(k_ts$k)
plot(ansvar,cpt.col='blue')
```

It seems the signal in variance changes is more useful to discern the change points in the time-series. Let's have a look at the model:

```{r}
ansvar
```
